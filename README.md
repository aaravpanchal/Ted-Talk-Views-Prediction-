# **Project Summary -**

TED is devoted to spreading powerful ideas on just about any topic. These datasets contain over 4,000 TED talks including transcripts in many languages Founded in 1984 by Richard Salman as a nonprofit organization that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment, and Design together. TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan, and Bill Gates.

In this project, we will try to understand the data by performing EDA on useful KPIs and create some insights. We will also try to understand that what are the factors that are associated for generating more views.

# **Problem Statement -**

We have given various features and one target feature 'views'. We need create a predictive model for predicting 'views' and validate that model. We also have to perfom EDA around 'views' and other features as well followed by Data Wrangling and Data Cleaning

Our Project Workflow:

*  Importing Libraries

*  Loading the dataset

*  Data Cleaning

*  EDA on features

*  Hypothesis Testing

*  Feature selection

*  Fitting the regression models

*  HyperParameter Tuning

*  Evaluation Metrices of the model

*  Final selection of the model

*  Conclusion

Libraries we will use to perform these:

*  Data wrangling : Numpy and Pandas

*  Data Visualization : Matplotlib and Seaborn

*  Hypothesis Testing: Scipy

*  Machine learning : Scikit Learn and XGBoost
